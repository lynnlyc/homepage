abstract = {Current mobile operating systems such as Android employ the permission-based access control mechanism, but it is difficult for users to understand how and why the permissions are used within a particular application. This paper introduces permission-UI mapping as an easy-to-understand representation to illustrate how permissions are used by different UI components within a given application. Connecting UI components to permissions helps users to understand the purpose of permission requests and also makes it possible to illustrate permission requests in a fine-grained manner. We propose PERUIM to extract the permission-UI mapping from an application based on both dynamic and static analysis, and represent the analysis results with a graphical representation. Experiments on popular mobile applications demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Smartphone app developers often access and use privacy-sensitive data to create apps with rich and meaningful interactions. However, it can be challenging for auditors and end-users to know what granularity of data is being used and how, thereby hindering assessment of potential risks. Furthermore, developers lack easy ways of offering transparency to users regarding how personal data is processed, even if their intentions are to make their apps more privacy friendly. To address these challenges, we introduce PrivacyStreams, a functional programming model for accessing and processing personal data as a stream. PrivacyStreams is designed to make it easy for developers to make use of personal data while simultaneously making it easier to analyze how that personal data is processed and what granularity of data is actually used. We present the design and implementation of PrivacyStreams, as well as several user studies and experiments to demonstrate its usability, utility, and support for privacy.},

abstract = {Deep learning models have been deployed to a wide range of edge devices. Since the data distribution on edge devices may differ from the cloud where the model was trained, it is typically desirable to customize the model for each edge device to improve accuracy. However, such customization is hard because collecting data from edge devices is usually prohibited due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose PMC, a privacy-preserving model customization framework to effectively customize a CNN model from the cloud to edge devices without collecting raw data. Instead, we introduce a method to extract statistical information from the edge, which contains adequate domain-related knowledge for model customization. PMC uses Gaussian distribution parameters to describe the edge data distribution, reweights the cloud data based on the parameters, and uses the reweighted data to train a specialized model for the edge device. During this process, differential privacy can be enforced by adding computed noises to the Gaussian parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that PMC can improve model accuracy by a large margin through customization. Finally, a study on user-generated data demonstrates the effectiveness of PMC in real-world settings.},
